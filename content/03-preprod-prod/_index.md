**Review Note:** The pre-production test and production environment section is only sketched out topically at this stage. We expect to begin addressing this section after drafting the higher priority [Development Fast Follow Capabilities]({{< relref "02-dev-fast-follow" >}}) section. If you have comments and suggestions about this guide, see [Contributing]({{< relref "03-contributors" >}}).

Once you've established your initial foundation and delivered the initial set of development environments to teams, your next step is to expand your foundation by introducing a set of capabilities that organizations typically require before moving workloads into production.
