Beyond supporting initial development and early testing within the development environments, your organization will soon need to support formal testing and eventually production hosting of your new applications and data services.  The following diagram represents typical extensions to your cloud foundation and a new set of AWS accounts to support formal testing and production hosting environments.

Key aspects of a solution that supports a typical transition toward support for several projects and their workloads progressing toward formal pre-production testing and production include:

## Separate AWS Accounts for Hosting Pre-Production Test and Production Workloads

AWS best practices recommend isolating pre-production test and production workloads, data, and supporting cloud resources from each other and from development environments through the use of distinct AWS accounts.  Whether your organization chooses to define pre-production test and production AWS hosting accounts based on the owning delivery teams, collections of related services, or another basis, will depend on your requirements.  Typically some analysis and design is needed to define the specific approach.

## Separate AWS Accounts for Shared Builder Services

Similarly, AWS best practices recommend that one or more separate AWS accounts are established to host shared builder services that are used to help build, test, and release your applications and cloud resources to the pre-production test and production hosting environments. Since CI/CD pipelines, source code management, artifact repositories, and other builder resources are considered production resources, they are not typically managed in development environments. Again, some degree of analysis and design is typically needed to identify the specific approach that best suits your requirements.

## Expanded Use of AWS Transit Gateway to Support Test and Production VPCs

If your pre-productuction test and production workloads need to integrate with on-premises resources and services, the AWS Transit Gateway configuration can be extended to enable routing between those environments.

## Cloud Hosted Internet Ingress and Egress Security Services

If your organization has strict requirements for securing Internet access, then hosting your enterprise standard security services in a dedicated set of VPCs managed within the **network-prod** AWS account is a common pattern.  This cloud hosted approach to securing Internet integration is more performant than depending on routing traffic back on-premises.

See the following AWS Blog posts up-to-date examples of how to use AWS Transit Gateway and third party products to support cloud-hosted ingress and egress security requirements:
